# Clustering on tennis players statistics
Project for the Advanced Multivariate Statistics exam.

In this project we run different clustering algorithms on a dataset containing real-world tennis statistics of different players. Our goal is to show that players will be grouped differently depending on the clustering algorithm we use. We will pre-process the dataset and then run a series of algorithms using different distance measures when implemented. Internal evaluation will show that differences do exist among clustering algorithms.
